# Analysis Overview
Continue work from the module in evaluating ride sharing options for the CEO of PyBer ride share.
Look at differences in ridership, available drivers, and fares depending on the area in which the service is being used
Use new Python visualization tools to provide easy understanding of key differences delineated by the data.
Look at economic options by weekly fares for riders and drivers

  ## Service Area
  As might be expected there are less drivers available in rural settings as opposed to urban or suburban settings.
  
  # Fares
  Average fares are highest rural where there are the fewest drivers. Fares are highest in rural areas.
  
  ## Recommendations
  
  I would suggest that PyBer's CEO consider trying to normalize the number of drivers across the settings so that rural customers have more options.
